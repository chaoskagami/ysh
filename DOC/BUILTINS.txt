Basic
--------------------

cd [dir]
   Change directory to dir, relative to the current working directory.
   Omission of dir will change directory to $HOME.

Math
--------------------
General math functions. They all take any number of arguments and
perform the operation on all arguments (or relative to the first,
with subtraction/division)

If an optional single-character prefix is specified (x, X, o) before
the operator the output will take the form of lowercase hexadecimal,
uppercase hexadecimal or octal.

Prefixes are interpreted in the input, so the value 0xDEADBEEF will
be treated as hexadecimal.

[xXo]+ ...
   Add the arguments provided together and print the result.

[xXo]- ...
   Subtract in order starting from the first argument and print the
   result.

[xXo]* ...
   Multiply the arguments provided together and print the result.

[xXo]/ ...
   Perform integer division in order with the first argument as the
   dividend, with subsequent results becoming the divident and print the
   result.

[xXo]% ...
   Calculate the modulo (integer remainder) in order with the first
   argument as the dividend, with subsequent results becoming the
   divident and print the result.
